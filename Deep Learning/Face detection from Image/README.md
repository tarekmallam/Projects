Face Detection with OpenCV
This project demonstrates how to perform face detection using OpenCV, a popular open-source computer vision library.

Overview
Face detection is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves locating and identifying human faces within images. In this project, we utilize the Haar Cascade classifier, a machine learning-based approach, to detect faces in an image.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2) library
You can install OpenCV via pip:

pip install opencv-python

Usage
Clone the repository or download the source code.

Navigate to the project directory.

Ensure you have an image file (img.jpg) in the project directory that contains one or more faces you want to detect.

Run the Python script face_detection.py:

The script will display the original image with rectangles drawn around the detected faces. Press any key to close the image window.
How it Works
Loading Pre-Trained Model: We load a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier specifically designed for frontal face detection.

Image Processing: We load an image and convert it to grayscale, a common practice for efficient face detection.

Detecting Faces: Using the detectMultiScale function, we scan the grayscale image for faces at various scales and return the locations.

Drawing Rectangles: For each detected face, we draw a rectangle around it to visually mark the detected region.

Displaying Results: Finally, we display the original image with the detected faces highlighted.

Example
Here's a brief example of what the output looks like:


Further Improvements
Experiment with different parameters for face detection to achieve better accuracy.
Explore other pre-trained models or custom training for face detection.
Integrate this functionality into larger projects such as video processing or facial recognition systems.
